# Accident Detection in Self-Driving Vehicles using Computer Vision

## Introduction
Accident Detection in Self-Driving Vehicles using Computer Vision is a project aimed at developing a robust system capable of identifying accidents in real-time using self-driving cars. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this system analyzes images captured by vehicle cameras to detect potential accidents and take necessary preventive actions. The project heavily relies on Python, OpenCV, and edge detection algorithms to enhance the accuracy and reliability of accident detection.
